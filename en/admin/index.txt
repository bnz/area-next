The lavish coat makes this already large breed look even larger. The insulated, waterproof double coat was designed to withstand Scandinavian winters and features a full frontal ruff (hair around the neck), bushy tail, rear britches and tufted paws. ‚ÄúThey really do look as though they walked out of a fairy-tale forest,‚Äù Keiger says,\n\nOften known for their brown tabby-and-white coats, Norwegian Forest cats actually come in nearly every possible coat pattern and color combination, except pointed, chocolate and lilac.","datetime":"2025-05-10T17:17"},{"slug":"bombay","title":"Bombay","excerpt":"Want a little panther in your life?

While these cats appear fine-boned and dainty, they are actually hard-bodied and muscular, slender with a deep curve to the chest rising up to a tucked-up waist, which is why they‚Äôre often referred to as the Greyhound of the cat world.\n\nTheir head is egg-shaped and topped with tall ears, while their expressive oval eyes have a slight upward slant.\n\nBut the most unique feature of the Cornish Rex is their coat, which is noticeably curly, falling into marcel waves. Even the eyebrows and whiskers are curled. The coat, which comes in all colors and patterns, is short, close to the body and incredibly soft to the touch.","datetime":"2025-05-10T16:15"}],"splits":[{"title":"–ú–∏–Ω–∏–º—É–º –¥–µ–π—Å—Ç–≤–∏–π ‚Äî –º–∞–∫—Å–∏–º—É–º —ç—Ñ—Ñ–µ–∫—Ç–∏–≤–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∏","subTitle":"–ù–∞–∑–Ω–∞—á–∞–π—Ç–µ –ø—Ä–∏—ë–º—ã, –≤–µ–¥–∏—Ç–µ –∏—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—é –±–æ–ª–µ–∑–Ω–∏ –∏ –ø—Ä–æ—Å–º–∞—Ç—Ä–∏–≤–∞–π—Ç–µ –∞–Ω–∞–ª–∏–∑—ã –≤ –æ–¥–∏–Ω –∫–ª–∏–∫.","image":"/data/images/202504202404beautiful-cat-breed-norwegian-cat-breed.avif"},{"title":"–í—Å—ë –ø–æ–¥ —Ä—É–∫–æ–π","subTitle":"–ü–æ–ª–Ω—ã–π –¥–æ—Å—Ç—É–ø –∫ –º–µ–¥–∏—Ü–∏–Ω—Å–∫–∏–º –∫–∞—Ä—Ç–∞–º, —Ä–µ–∑—É–ª—å—Ç–∞—Ç–∞–º –∏—Å—Å–ª–µ–¥–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏–π –∏ –∫–æ–º–º—É–Ω–∏–∫–∞—Ü–∏—è–º —Å –ø–∞—Ü–∏–µ–Ω—Ç–∞–º–∏ ‚Äî –≤ –æ–¥–Ω–æ–º –æ–∫–Ω–µ.","image":"/data/images/202504202404beautiful-cats-oriental-cat-breeds.avif"},{"title":"asdsad","subTitle":"asdasdsa","image":"/data/images/202504202404beautiful-cats-cornish-rex.avif"}]},"children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100 flex flex-col min-h-full -mb-[50px]","children":[["$","header",null,{"className":"w-full px-6 py-6 flex justify-between items-center","children":[["$","$L16",null,{"href":"/en","className":"text-2xl font-semibold tracking-tight hover:opacity-80 transition","children":"Arija"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"flex","children":[["$","nav",null,{"className":"flex text-sm mr-2","children":[["$","$L17",null,{"href":"/contacts","className":"hover:underline text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 px-2 flex items-center","children":"Contacts"}],["$","$L17",null,{"href":"/blog","className":"hover:underline text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 px-2 flex items-center","children":"Blog"}]]}],["$","$11",null,{"fallback":null,"children":["$","$L18",null,{}]}]]}]]}],["$","main",null,{"children":["$","$L4",null,{"parallelRouterKey":"children","error":"$undefined","errorStyles":"$undefined","errorScripts":"$undefined","template":["$","$L5",null,{}],"templateStyles":"$undefined","templateScripts":"$undefined","notFound":[["$","div",null,{"style":{"padding":"4rem","textAlign":"center"},"children":[["$","h1",null,{"children":"404 ‚Äî –°—Ç—Ä–∞–Ω–∏—Ü–∞ –Ω–µ –Ω–∞–π–¥–µ–Ω–∞"}],["$","p",null,{"children":"–í—ã –≤–≤–µ–ª–∏ –Ω–µ–≤–µ—Ä–Ω—ã–π —è–∑—ã–∫ –∏–ª–∏ –∞–¥—Ä–µ—Å."}]]}],[]],"forbidden":"$undefined","unauthorized":"$undefined"}]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"h-[50px]"}]]}],["$","footer",null,{"className":"py-6 text-center text-sm text-gray-500 h-[50px]","children":"¬© 2025 Arija.
