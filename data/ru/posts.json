    "content": "A member of the Siamese group, the Oriental has the same body type as their Siamese parent: elegant, long, lithe and slender. What makes the Oriental distinct is their wide array of colors and patterns combined with a short, sleek coat. Keiger calls the Oriental a Siamese with a different pattern—300 plus of them, in fact.\n\nThe Oriental comes in both longhair and shorthair varieties, adding the opportunity for even more breathtaking colors and patterns.",
