What makes the Oriental distinct is their wide array of colors and patterns combined with a short, sleek coat. Keiger calls the Oriental a Siamese with a different patternâ€”300 plus of them, in fact.\n\nThe Oriental comes in both longhair and shorthair varieties, adding the opportunity for even more breathtaking colors and patterns.",
